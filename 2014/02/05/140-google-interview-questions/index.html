<li><p>There are some data represented by(x,y,z). Now we want to find the Kth least data. We say (x1, y1, z1) &gt; (x2, y2, z2) when value(x1, y1, z1) &gt; value(x2, y2, z2) where value(x,y,z) = (2^x)<em>(3^y)</em>(5^z). Now we can not get it by calculating value(x,y,z) or through other indirect calculations as lg(value(x,y,z)). How to solve it?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How many degrees are there in the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock when the time is a quarter past three?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Given an array whose elements are sorted, return the index of a the first occurrence of a specific integer. Do this in sub-linear time. I.e. do not just go through each element searching for that element.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Given two linked lists, return the intersection of the two lists: i.e. return a list containing only the elements that occur in both of the input lists.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What’s the difference between a hashtable and a hashmap?</p>
</li>
<li><p>If a person dials a sequence of numbers on the telephone, what possible words/strings can be formed from the letters associated with those numbers?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How would you reverse the image on an n by n matrix where each pixel is represented by a bit?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a fast cached storage mechanism that, given a limitation on the amount of cache memory, will ensure that only the least recently used items are discarded when the cache memory is reached when inserting a new item. It supports 2 functions: String get(T t) and void put(String k, T t).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a cost model that allows Google to make purchasing decisions on to compare the cost of purchasing more RAM memory for their servers vs. buying more disk space.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Design an algorithm to play a game of Frogger and then code the solution. The object of the game is to direct a frog to avoid cars while crossing a busy road. You may represent a road lane via an array. Generalize the solution for an N-lane road.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What sort would you use if you had a large data set on disk and a small amount of ram to work with?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What sort would you use if you required tight max time bounds and wanted highly regular performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How would you store 1 million phone numbers?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Design a 2D dungeon crawling game. It must allow for various items in the maze – walls, objects, and computer-controlled characters. (The focus was on the class structures, and how to optimize the experience for the user as s/he travels through the dungeon.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is the size of the C structure below on a 32-bit system? On a 64-bit?</p>
